PS. save current tab function will not work, it must run as an extension in order to fetch chrome.tab.url API.

To install it as chrome extension:
Download as Zip -> Unpack it -> Open Google Chrome -> Insert this link chrome://extensions/ in google chrome -> Click the "Load unpacked" button ->
Navigate to folder where you've unpacked the file -> Click "open"

To use:
Go to the top right of google chrome -> Click the puzzle icon/ chrome extensions -> Pin the extension for easy access.

Copy and paste link you want to save to the input text area then press "save link", or you can just save the current active tab by pressing "save current tab",
It will automaticly render the saved links under the buttons.

"Clear all saved links" Button will remove all saved links, it comes with confirmation, but still becareful!
